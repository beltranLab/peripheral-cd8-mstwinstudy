# Twin study identifies early immunological and metabolic dysregulation of CD8+ T cells in multiple sclerosis

## About
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory neurological disease of the central nervous system with a subclinical phase preceding frank neuroinflammation. CD8+ T cells are abundant within MS lesions, but their potential role in disease pathology remains unclear. Using high-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing and single-cell T cell receptor analysis, we compared antigen-experienced CD8+ T cell clones from the blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of monozygotic twin pairs in which the co-twin had either no, or subclinical neuroinflammation (SCNI). We identified peripheral MS-associated immunological and metabolic alterations indicative of an enhanced migratory, proinflammatory, and activated CD8+ T cell phenotype, which was also evident in co-twins with SCNI and in an independent validation cohort of people with MS (pwMS). Together, our in-depth single-cell analysis indicates a disease-driving proinflammatory role of infiltrating CD8+ T cells and identifies potential immunological and metabolic therapeutic targets in both prodromal and definitive stages of the disease.

Here we selected 12 twin pairs from the MS TWIN STUDY cohort, representing a sub-cohort comprising 12 MS-affected individuals, and their non-neuroinflammatory (n=6) or SCNI-affected (n=6) co-twins. We then applied **high-throughput scRNA-seq and single-cell T-cell receptor (TCR) sequencing** to characterize peripheral and CNS-migrated CD8+ T cells in each group, revealing distinct MS-associated immunological and metabolic alterations. These data pave the way for further understanding of pathological mechanisms underpinning disease onset and manifestation, and open new prospects for targeted diagnostic and therapeutic approaches in MS.
